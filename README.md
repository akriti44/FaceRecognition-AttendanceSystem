# FaceRecognition-AttendanceSystem
While humans are very effective at identifying known faces, when dealing with a lot of unfamiliar faces, they are not as well qualified. Facial recognition is a way of identifying or confirming an individualâ€™s identity using their face. Facial recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time. We aim to build an attendance system using face recognition technology as existing manual attendance system is time consuming, difficult to maintain and there may be chances of proxy attendance or human error. This system is implemented in four phases- database creation, face detection, face recognition and attendance updating. Images of the students are already stored in the database. Face location is detected from the classroom's live streaming video. This detected face location is further encoded to perform comparisons with the images stored in the database and recognize the particular student. The name of the said student will be stored in the excel sheet along with the time of entrance.
